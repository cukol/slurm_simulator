This simulator is based upon the work of Alejandro Lucero (Barcelona
SuperComputing Center) as described in the paper "Simulation of batch
scheduling using real production-ready software tools"

NOTE: It would generally be advisable to install the Slurm simulator on a
desktop system, not a real cluster managed by Slurm.

Build instructions:
0. Install appropriate infrastructure:
   mysql-client, mysql-server, mysql-common, libmysqlclient-dev
   munge, libmunge2, libmunge-dev

   Make sure the mysql database is running and grant the test user access:
   mysql> create user 'slurm'@'localhost' identified by 'ihatelsf'
   mysql> grant all privileges on *.* to 'slurm'@'localhost' with grant opt

   Make sure munge is configured and the daemon running.

1. Run configure with the "--enable-simulator" option. For example:
   ./configure --enable-simulator --prefix=/home/mine/install.sim

2. Build the Slurm daemons and commands:
   make -j install

3. Build the simulator tools:
   cd contribs/simulator
   make -j install

4. Create a subdirectory "tmp" for logs, which can be used by both the Slurm
   daemons and the simulator. "SIM_DIR" is your install path (the "prefix"
   specified in step #1):
   mkdir SIM_DIR/tmp

5. Build your Slurm configuration files as appropriate. Note that a single
   slurmd daemon will be used for any size cluster (Slurm's "front-end mode").
   For example (excerpt of SIM_DIR/etc/slurm.conf where "SIM_DIR" is your
   install path):
   FrontEndName=my_host
   NodeName=tux[0-7] Sockets=1 CoresPerSocket=6 CPUs=6 ThreadsPerCore=1

6. Start the slurmdbd program, which creates your database. This command line
   will start the daemon in the foreground and send output to your terminal.
   For example:
   SIM_DIR/sbin/slurmdbd -Dvv

7. Populate your database.
   Get a copy of the Slurm database from the system you want to emulate:
   SIM_DIR/bin/sacctmgr -i dump cluster=BASE_NAME file=/tmp/save

   Move the file to your desktop used for testing.

   Load the data into your local database:
   SIM_DIR/bin/sacctmgr -i load /tmp/save

   Create a file containing user IDs information. The format of the file should
   be "<user_name>:<user_id>" one per line. The file should be created in
   SIM_DIR/etc/users.sim. For example:
   $ cat SIM_DIR/etc/users.sim
   alan:1000
   brenda:1001

8. Validate that the slurmctld and slurmd daemons can be executed. These
   command lines will start the daemons in the foreground and send output to
   your terminal, so execute each command in its own windew. For example:
   SIM_DIR/sbin/slurmctld -Dcv
   SIM_DIR/sbin/slurmd -Dcv
   SIM_DIR/bin/sinfo

9. Stop the slurmctld and slurmd processes.

10.Start the daemons under the simulator:
   cd SIM_DIR/sbin
   ./exec_sim.pl SIM_DIR 100

   This scripts calls the sim_mgr program, which starts slurmctld and slurmd.
   After 10 seconds or so, run:
   ps axl | grep slurm

   If you do not see sim_mgr, slurmctld and slurmd programs there's a problem.
   Check exec_sim.log, sim_mgr.log, slurmcltd.log and slurmd_sim.log files in
   SIM_DIR/tmp.

   If the simulator runs file, see a log of completed jobs in the file
   SIM_DIR/tmp/job_comp.log

   Use the program SIMDIR/sbin/list_trace to get a list of launched jobs.
